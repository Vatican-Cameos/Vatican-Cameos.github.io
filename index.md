## Welcome !
My name is Pavan, I am a young programmer who built android applications/libraries for a living for about 4 years starting from the 2nd year of my undergraduate course. I also happened to take up a lot of MOOCs to feel out the reach and potential of Computer Science. I took up courses which taught me Python, object oriented programming in java and building REST APIs using nodeJS. As I delved deeper into this field which is the next thing to a super power, I found myself just scratching the surface of it. I happened to come across a problem in my work place where they were trying to detect plant diseases based on visuals, crop recommendations for farmers which fascinated me and got me into Machine Learning. I have been passionately doing Machine Learning since then.   
You can head over to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavanvenkatesh/) to look at how I have spent my life so far in detail.
